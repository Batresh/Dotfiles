# Heavydot deployment
Note to self.
1. Add network mirror repo sources, update && full-upgrade. Ensure there's no errors
2. 'bear' keywords in setup.sh gets replaced depending on username
3. setup.sh
4. Install panel widgets before adding startup script to replace WM. (Buggy window floating).

if you happend to read this, the setup file assumes kde is already installed and is a debian platform

todo:

New composite manager with blur. (current one too cpu hungry)
