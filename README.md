Note to self.
1. Add network mirror repo sources, update -y && full-upgrade. Ensure there's no errors
2. Replace 'bear' in setup.sh with your non-privileged user name
3. setup.sh
4. Install panel widgets before adding startup script to replace WM. (Buggy window floating).

todo:
New composite manager with blur. (current one too cpu hungry)
